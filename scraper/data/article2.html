          MUMBAI: In a major development in the TRP manipulation scam, Mumbai joint commissioner (crime) Milind Bharambe said Friday that ratings were manipulated to push English news channel
          <!-- -->
          Times Now
          <!-- -->
          from the top slot to No. 2 and make Republic TV No. 1.
          Times Now was No. 1, but within a week of Republic TVâs launch in 2017, officials at the Broadcast Audience Research Council connived to push Times Now to No. 2, Bharambe said. (Times Now is part of the Times Group, to which this paper belongs.)
          <span class="strong">
           BARC
          </span>
          <span class="strong">
           found out about manipulations in June but didnât inform us, say cops
          </span>
          Similarly, another news channel, CNN-News 18 (formerly CNN-IBN), was pushed to the third slot from its second position, officials said. Bharambe said the manipulations came to light in a forensic audit by a third party at the instance of BARC in June this year, but the findings were not shared with police, which launched an investigation a few months ago and registered an FIR on October 6. BARC India measures the viewership of TV channels, which is crucial for broadcasters to decide on advertising.
          âThe auditing was done for 44 weeks in detail on English and Telugu news channels and a few entertainment channels, and it was found to be manipulated to a great extent. The TRP ratings were pre-decided and to achieve the highest TRP for particular channels, viewership data was manipulated using three methods,â Bharambe said. Police said they have come upon WhatsApp chats and emails between BARC employees discussing how to manipulate the ratings. The three methods employed for manipulation, Bharambe said, were âoutlier, meta rules and channel audience controlâ.
          âData was selectively analysed to show particular TRP ratings of a channel,â Bharambe said. He said this was done to facilitate and bring Republic TV to the No. 1 slot.
          The manipulations were carried out by two senior BARC officials during the period 2016-2019, police alleged. These officials, the CEO and COO, were asked to resign or face action by BARC, Bharambe said. Both officials quit and are in police custody. âDuring that period, there were complaints of manipulation that were suppressed,â he said. Police officials claimed BARC had knowledge about the officialsâ involvement but did not inform the cops during its probe. Cops came to know about audit report through their own sources and from detailed interrogation of the two arrested ex-officials, they said. Bharambe read out some excerpts from the messages found. âPlease find below numbers on English news. As required, Times Nowâs numbers were changed while Republic was kept the same.â Another message read, âPlease find below updates on English news channels for week X. Times Now, CNN -News18 will be changed. The impressions of Times Now had been decreased drastically across the universe. The impressions of Republic TV remained unchanged.â He declined to disclose the identities of people who had shared these messages.
          Bharambe said the forensic report is a strong piece of evidence and police will be adding it in the supplementary chargesheet. Police have already submitted a chargesheet in the case. Police said their investigations have revealed that the arrested persons connived to manipulate the sampling metering services by inducing barometer users by paying them periodically to watch particular channels. Many people in whose homes barometers were installed have acknowledged benefiting monetarily for keeping their TV sets on.
          The ex-CEO of BARC, arrested on Thursday, was produced before Esplanade Court on Friday and remanded in police custody till December 28. He is the 15th person held in the case. In a statement, Republic TV described policeâs Friday revelations as a âridiculous and bizarre witchhuntâ.
