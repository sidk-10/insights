             <em>
              “As per the report, yes,” Milind Bharambe, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime), Mumbai Police, said.
             </em>
            </p>
            <p>
             Nearly three months after the Mumbai Police busted a major racket for manipulating television rating points (TRP), details of the investigation have revealed that former CEO of the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) Partho Dasgupta, who was arrested on Thursday, had facilitated malpractices with other TV news channels to degrade the ratings of Times Now.
            </p>
            <p>
             Addressing a press conference in Mumbai, Bharambe said that TRP manipulation had been happening since 2016 where ratings appeared to be pre-decided.
            </p>
            <p>
             The scam took place when Dasgupta was the head of BARC from 2013 to 2019. During that period, many tried to expose the manipulation that was being done but whistleblowers were clinically suppressed. He has now been taken in to custody till December 28.
            </p>
            <p>
             “After the new dispensation took over at BARC, forensic audit of data was organised and the third-party audit team submitted its report in July 2020. As per the report, the manipulations have been going on at least from 2016-2019. The forensic team analysed data of around 44 weeks in detail, especially in the genre of English and Telugu news where they found manipulation to a great extent,” Bharambe said.
            </p>
            <p>
             As per the forensic report, the data of 44 weeks – from mid-2017 – mentions how viewership and TRP data was manipulated by using three of their methodologies, in which two channels are mentioned as per the report – Times Now (which was on No 1 in English at that time) was thrown to No 2 due to manipulation of data and Republic TV was put on No 1 spot.
            </p>
            <p>
             The report further states that in some of the cases, the ratings appeared to be pre-decided. The report also pointed towards the cartelisation of top officials and ex-officials of BARC.
            </p>
            <p>
             “Of the 3 methods used to screen and analyse the data – Outlier method, Meta method and Channel Audience Control – the data was selectively chosen, analysed and thrown to showcase a particular TRP rating of a particular channel. The report also mentions quite a few emails and chats between the top officials which point towards all these types of manipulations, which are absolutely incriminating,” the top cop said.

             <strong>
              Republic TV ‘laughs’ at allegations

            </h2>
            <p>
             The Mumbai Police’s claims are laughable. The Republic Media Network would like to destroy their claims with the following points:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              BARC has on two occasions written email to Republic dates 17 October 2020 and 20 November 2020, saying there was no question of any manipulation by Republic TV.
             </li>
             <li>
              The forensic report that the Mumbai Police is referring to is from July 2020. BARC’s emails to us are from November and December 2020. It defies common sense why BARC would give Republic Media Network a complete clean chit in November and December. The Mumbai Police should have thought about that.
             </li>
             <li>
              Republic Media Network’s ratings soared high in 2020 after the previous dispensation at BARC moved out. If you look at the data, the viewership increased in the second half of 2020. Does that Mumbai Police have any explanation for this? Or does it hold the current dispensation at BARC guilty for the viewership of Republic TV?
             </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
             The development related to ex-employees of BARC India is a part of an ongoing investigation for which BARC management continues to extend its support and cooperation to the law enforcement agencies. It would consequently be inappropriate for BARC to comment any further at this stage.
            </p>
            <p>
             Every employee of BARC India is expected to conform to a Code of Conduct &amp; Ethics and any infringement invites suitable disciplinary action.
